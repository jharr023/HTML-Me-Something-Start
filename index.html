         <h2>Where I'm From</h2>
         <p>I was born in Kansas City, and grew up nearby in Olathe, Kansas. When I left for college, I moved to Lawrence to attend the University of Kansas. 
            As of writing this entry, I still live in Lawrence, sharing a place with some friends.</p>

         <h2>Coding Journey</h2>
         <p>In High School, I was certain I wanted to be an Aerospace Engineer, and in my preparation, I took a basic introductory programming class.
            In College, I realized I didn't know what I wanted to major in, and in my couple years of exploring topics, I took a slightly more in-depth programming class.
            Now, having put my college education on hold until I'm certain in a major, I'm enrolled in LaunchCode, learning to be a programmer!
            In the months to come, I hope I'll graduate from Launchcode with skills that will land me a job in the programming field, although I don't know what specifically I'd like to do.
